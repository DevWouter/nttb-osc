# NTTB Open Source Community



The NTTB Open Source Community \(also called the NTTB-OSC or OSC for short\) is a community focused on creating and maintaining open source community around everything tabletennis related \(or ping-pong or whiff-whaff\). Although the NTTB is a dutch table tennis organization we encourage everyone to support players, organizations, clubs and communities world wide.

Following are a few starting points if you are new to the NTTB-OSC:

* What are the goals of the goals of the NTTB-OSC?
* How is the NTTB-OSC organized?
* I have created something \(application or documentation\)
* I want to know how I can support
* I want to volunteer but I don't know how
* I want to volunteer in a specefic way
* I'm from a national federation and I want to know my role
*
