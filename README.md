# NTTB Open Source Community

The NTTB Open Source Community (also called the NTTB-OSC or OSC for short) is a community focused on creating and maintaining open source community around everything tabletennis related (or ping-pong or whiff-whaff). Although the NTTB is a dutch table tennis federation we encourage everyone to support players, organizations, clubs, sport federations and communities world wide.

In this repository you will find documentation how the community is managed.
