# OSC Organization

## Responsabilities

The OSC has the following responsibilies:

* Promoting open source projects \(including external projects\)
* Fostering communication between projects
* Onboarding and offboarding projects
* Onboarding and offboarding volunteers of projects
* Providing mentorship \(where requisted\)
* Providing access to knowledge

It's important to realize that the OSC doesn't determine how projects are run or what a project should do. That is up to the individual projects themselves.
