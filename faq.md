# FAQ

## Questions about the community

### Why is it called NTTB-OSC?

Because we started out and received support from the dutch table tennis federation (NTTB). At the time of writing we are mostly developing solutions for the NTTB. Maybe in the future we can rebrand it to the ITTF-OSC (hint, hint ðŸ˜‰)

### What is the relationship with the NTTB?

Nothing besides the name and the regular contact our members have with the people within the NTTB.  
We have chosen on purpose to not be part of the NTTB. As such we only borrow the name (with permission) to make it easier for everyone to find us

### Why english?

We prefer a broad community and as such we choose english as our primary communication language.
