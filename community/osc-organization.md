# OSC Organization

## Types of users

Within the OSC we recognize the following roles:

* Community members
* Project members
* Facilitators

## Responsabilities

The OSC has the following responsibilies:

* Creating a community
* Providing knowledge
* Onboarding and offboarding projects
* Onboarding and offboarding volunteers of projects

It's important to realize that the OSC doesn't determine how projects are run or what a project should do. That is up to the individual projects themselves.

## Limitations

* The highest authority within the community are the facilitators
* The highest authority within the project is project goverment
* External organisations (including international federation) have no additional rights within the project
* Ownership of a project is determined by the project, neither the community or the facilitator can claim ownership.

Examples

* Breaching community guidelines allows the facilitators to remove a project or person from the community but not from a project.
  * So if a person in a project doesn't follow community guidelines and gets protected by the project, the worst we can do is remove the project.
* A member of a sport federation (or any other external organization) doesn't automatically grant you additional rights.
* A sport federation can't demand that we hand have over a project nor do we allow any interference in a project

## Ownership

The ownership of a project always lies with project, never the community. As such the community (or the facilitators representing the community) can't be legal entities that own a project. As such the OSC also can't represent you

In simpeler terms: The people who work on the project determine who owns the project.
