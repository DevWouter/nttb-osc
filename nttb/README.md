# NTTB

> In this document we describe the role of the NTTB and the NTTB-OSC.

## The long and short version

The NTTB and the NTTB-OSC have no direct relationship other than sharing the name.

In the Github of the NTTB you will find projects that are managed by the NTTB-OSC, not the NTTB itself. The projects are managed by invidiual or groups. The NTTB can not dictate the direct the projects, but because of our shared intresest it is safe to say that more often than not they will align.

The NTTB supports and invest in the open-source community. Because of the name the NTTB can claim the github repository, but not the content of the repository. This would also be against their own intrest since such a move would certainly upset the community.

## Can I use the NTTB?

Only when approved by the NTTB.
