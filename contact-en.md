# Contact

## Language

Although the majority is dutch, we prefer to use english in our communication. This allows our community to expand outside our borders. It doesn't need to be perfect as long as we understand one another.

## Contacting

Contacting the OSC is **not** the same as contacting the NTTB. We are a community of developers.

If you have an issue/question/remarks about a project, please follow the communication guidelines of that project.

If you have an issue/question/remarks for the NTTB-OSC as a community you can create an ticket. We prefer open communication in english, but dutch is also possible.

If for some reason you don't want to communicate in public, you can contact the NTTB through [dwf@nttb.nl](mailto:dwf@nttb.nl) (dutch or english). The NTTB will then contact the OSC organization and you can choose to keep your name confedential.
